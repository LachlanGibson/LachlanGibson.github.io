He began his educational journey at the University of Queensland, where he pursued a dual program of a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts from 2011 to 2014 with extended majors in Physics and Mathematics respectively. During his undergraduate years, Dr. Gibson was heavily involved in research programs, including the Advanced Study Program in Science (ASPinS), and was recognized by the UQ Summer Research Scholarship Program for three consecutive years.<br><br>His desire for continuous learning led him to attain his Bachelor of Science (Honours) in 2015, achieving First Class Honours. His dedication was evident through his participation in a Simulation Group Internship, where he worked on simulations of the proposed Brisbane BaT tunnel.<br><br>Dr. Gibson further expanded his knowledge base by pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (Physics) from 2016 to 2019. His thesis focused on the mathematical and computational modelling of fluid dynamics relevant to optical-tweezers systems. He then added to his expertise by completing a Masters of Data Science in 2020 with a capstone study project on Categorical Vector Clustering.<br><br>Following his academic pursuits, Dr. Gibson embarked on a career as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Queensland from August 2020 to December 2022. His work involved researching rare-event simulation via generative neural networks and reinforcement learning applied to AI safety. His research also delved into environmental effects on fishery risk and reinforcement learning methods for controlling restless multi-armed bandits. He also served as an Academic Tutor from 2016 to 2020 for various Mathematics and Physics courses, highlighting his commitment to educating others.<br><br>Besides his professional accomplishments, Dr. Gibson has shown a commendable spirit of volunteerism. He has taken on roles such as Assistant Secretary and Sound Technician at Salisbury Baptist Church from 2013 to 2022, providing administrative and technical support for the organization. He has also volunteered as a Youth Leader, mentoring high school students from the church and local community. Additionally, he contributed to Scripture Union as a camp leader, and as an English Conversation Club Volunteer Helper at UQ's Institute of Continuing & TESOL Education.<br><br>With his impressive educational qualifications, extensive research experience, and a strong commitment to service, Dr. Lachlan Gibson stands as an accomplished physicist and data scientist, dedicated to advancing knowledge and improving the community.<br></p></section></main><footer class="p-4"><div class="sm:flex sm:items-center sm:justify-between"><span class="text-sm text-gray-500 sm:text-center dark:text-gray-400">Â© 2024 Lachlan Gibson</span><div class="flex mt-2 sm:justify-center sm:mt-0"><a class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 dark:hover:text-white ms-5" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lachlan-james-gibson/" aria-label="Visit Lachlan's LinkedIn profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-4 h-4" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4.98 3.5c0 1.381-1.11 2.5-2.48 2.5s-2.48-1.119-2.48-2.5c0-1.38 1.11-2.5 2.48-2.5s2.48 1.12 2.48 2.5zm.02 4.5h-5v16h5v-16zm7.982 0h-4.968v16h4.969v-8.399c0-4.67 6.029-5.052 6.029 0v8.399h4.988v-10.131c0-7.88-8.922-7.593-11.018-3.714v-2.155z"></path></svg><span class="sr-only">LinkedIn account</span></a><a class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 dark:hover:text-white ms-5" href="https://github.com/LachlanGibson" aria-label="Visit Lachlan's GitHub profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-4 h-4" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10 .333A9.911 9.911 0 0 0 6.866 19.65c.5.092.678-.215.678-.477 0-.237-.01-1.017-.014-1.845-2.757.6-3.338-1.169-3.338-1.169a2.627 2.627 0 0 0-1.1-1.451c-.9-.615.07-.6.07-.6a2.084 2.084 0 0 1 1.518 1.021 2.11 2.11 0 0 0 2.884.823c.044-.503.268-.973.63-1.325-2.2-.25-4.516-1.1-4.516-4.9A3.832 3.832 0 0 1 4.7 7.068a3.56 3.56 0 0 1 .095-2.623s.832-.266 2.726 1.016a9.409 9.409 0 0 1 4.962 0c1.89-1.282 2.717-1.016 2.717-1.016.366.83.402 1.768.1 2.623a3.827 3.827 0 0 1 1.02 2.659c0 3.807-2.319 4.644-4.525 4.889a2.366 2.366 0 0 1 .673 1.834c0 1.326-.012 2.394-.012 2.72 0 .263.18.572.681.475A9.911 9.911 0 0 0 10 .333Z" clip-rule="evenodd" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg><span class="sr-only">GitHub account</span></a><a class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 dark:hover:text-white ms-5" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeEMSU0AAAAJ&hl=en" aria-label="Visit Lachlan's Google Scholar profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-4 h-4" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 256 256" height="50px" width="50px"><g transform="scale(5.12,5.12)"><path d="M25,2c-12.69047,0 -23,10.30953 -23,23c0,12.69047 10.30953,23 23,23c12.69047,0 23,-10.30953 23,-23c0,-12.69047 -10.30953,-23 -23,-23zM25,4c11.60953,0 21,9.39047 21,21c0,11.60953 -9.39047,21 -21,21c-11.60953,0 -21,-9.39047 -21,-21c0,-11.60953 9.39047,-21 21,-21zM21,11l-10,9h6.78125c0.02,2.847 2.18628,5.73047 5.98828,5.73047c0.36,0 0.76016,-0.04008 1.16016,-0.08008c-0.18,0.45 -0.36914,0.81969 -0.36914,1.42969c0,1.15 0.57984,1.84 1.08984,2.5c-1.63,0.11 -4.66062,0.29945 -6.89062,1.68945c-2.13,1.29 -2.7793,3.16047 -2.7793,4.48047c0,2.72 2.52,5.25 7.75,5.25c6.2,0 9.49023,-3.48945 9.49023,-6.93945c0,-2.53 -1.44125,-3.78063 -3.03125,-5.14062l-1.28906,-1.0293c-0.4,-0.32 -0.95117,-0.77031 -0.95117,-1.57031c0,-0.81 0.55148,-1.33055 1.02148,-1.81055c1.51,-1.2 3.0293,-2.54953 3.0293,-5.26953c0,-1.043 -0.2438,-1.89184 -0.5918,-2.58984l3.5918,-3.08008v3.70703c-0.595,0.346 -1,0.98366 -1,1.72266v6c0,1.104 0.896,2 2,2c1.104,0 2,-0.896 2,-2v-6c0,-0.738 -0.405,-1.37566 -1,-1.72266v-5.27734c0,-0.043 -0.01939,-0.07909 -0.02539,-0.12109l1.02539,-0.87891zM24.26953,14.24023c3,0 4.55078,4.10977 4.55078,6.75977c0,0.65 -0.08039,1.81992 -0.90039,2.66992c-0.58,0.59 -1.54898,1.0293 -2.45898,1.0293c-3.09,0 -4.51172,-4.07906 -4.51172,-6.53906c0,-0.95 0.19078,-1.93922 0.80078,-2.69922c0.58,-0.75 1.58953,-1.2207 2.51953,-1.2207zM26.03906,30.60938c0.37,0 0.5518,0.00102 0.8418,0.04102c2.74,1.98 3.91992,2.96984 3.91992,4.83984c0,2.27 -1.83078,3.9707 -5.30078,3.9707c-3.86,0 -6.33984,-1.87047 -6.33984,-4.48047c0,-2.61 2.29961,-3.48125 3.09961,-3.78125c1.51,-0.52 3.4593,-0.58984 3.7793,-0.58984z"></path></g></svg><span class="sr-only">Google Scholar account</span></a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
