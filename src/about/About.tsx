Ranging from presidential elections, to social media likes, voting
generally involves putting forward an opinion about an item, such
as a person, idea or product. Therefore, voters are generally
motivated to remain anonymous or avoid voting entirely, especially
when voting requires effort or is on a sensitive issue. As such,
datasets of votes are often sparse and include minimal explicit
information about the voters or items. However, much of this
information can still exist implicitly within the vote values
themselves, because votes are usually correlated to features of
both the voters and items. I have identified and developed a
denoising autoencoder neural network model that can be trained
on a sparse dataset of votes to automatically classify voters and
items into latent classes and then predict missing votes using these
classifications. The autoencoder classifies voters or items completely
unsupervised by using a softmax activation function at the code layer,
as well as regularising terms in the training loss function that minimise
the code entropy. Using votes made in the U.S. House of Representatives
from 1990 to May 2020 as an example, the model correctly predicted
missing votes with 92.6% accuracy. Furthermore, some of the learnt latent
classes corresponded to interpretable categories, such as party
affiliation, which could be identified with a 99.5% accuracy.`,

          I pursued a dual Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degree,
          majoring in Mathematics and Physics. During the initial phase
          (2011-2014), I achieved a GPA of 6.66/7.00. In 2015, I completed an
          honours year in Physics, earning first class honours with a GPA of
          6.75/7.00. As a participant in the Advanced Study Program in Science
          (ASPinS) and the UQ Summer Research Scholarship Programs for three
          consecutive years, I actively engaged in research throughout my
          undergraduate studies. This research was presented at various
          conferences, including the UQ ASPinS Undergraduate Research
          Conferences (2011-2013) and the UQ Undergraduate Research Conferences
          (2012-2013), where I won the best poster award in 2012. In 2015, I
          interned at The Simulation Group, where I contributed to the AnyLogic
          simulation of Brisbane's proposed Bus and Train tunnel. Throughout my
          studies, my academic achievements were recognised with multiple Dean's
          Commendations for High Achievement/Academic Excellence.
