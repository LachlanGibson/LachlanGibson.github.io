                variables that could mimic arbitrary distributions, especially
                ones conditioned on rare events. The initial framework we
                developed included two neural networks that were trained
                simultaneously using a target function. One was a generative
                model and the other estimated the probability density function
                of the first. We later refined the framework to use a single{" "}

              During my time as a postdoctoral research fellow at UQ I worked
              with Peter Jacko and Yoni Nazarathy to develop a method built on
              an understanding of both the Whittle index and Q-learning for
              learning index rules for multi-armed bandits, restless bandits,
              and dynamic resource allocation. Our approach seemed to be able to
              deliver similar or better performance than other state-of-the-art
              methods but was potentially applicable to a much broader and more
              general set of problems.

            <p>
              For my Master of Data Science capstone project in 2020 I developed
              a denoising autoencoder neural network model that could be trained
              on sparse datasets of votes to automatically classify voters and
              items into latent classes and then predict missing votes using
              these classifications. The autoencoder classifies voters or items
              completely unsupervised. The model correctly predicted missing
              votes made in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1990 to May
              2020 with 92.6% accuracy. Furthermore, some of the learnt latent
              classes corresponded to interpretable categories, such as party
              affiliation, which could be identified with a 99.5% accuracy.

                  Light carries momentum, and when a laser is tightly focused
                  under a microscope, it can exert forces on microscopic
                  objects. This is the principle behind optical tweezers, a
                  powerful tool for manipulating very small particles. During my
                  undergraduate and PhD studies I worked with the Optical
                  Micro-manipulation Group at The University of Queensland to
                  research and develop novel techniques to apply optical
                  tweezers to the field of microrheology, measuring viscoelastic
                  properties of fluids in very small volumes by tracking the
                  motion of trapped particles.

                  Optical tweezers are often used to manipulate spheres that are
                  close to boundaries. During my PhD with the Optical
                  Micro-manipulation Group at The University of Queensland I
                  researched a range of analytical and numerical techniques for
                  calculating how these nearby boundaries affect the dynamics of
                  the trapped spheres. For example, the figure on the right
                  illustrates how the viscous forces on a trapped spinning
                  particle inside an artificial vesicle depend on how far it is
                  from the boundary. The red circles show the wall effects
                  measured by my colleague, and the green region shows the
                  theoretically computed values.
