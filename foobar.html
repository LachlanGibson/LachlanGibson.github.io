        <h1>The Google FooBar Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          Recently I completed Google's
          <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">FooBar</a>
          challenge during April 2023. This involved solving a series of
          mathematical and coding problems using Python 2.7 (or Java). The
          challenge included 5 levels of increasing difficulty with 1-3 tasks
          per level. I summarise in this document the tasks I received and
          explain how I solved each one. See the articles by
          <a
            href="https://www.turing.com/kb/foobar-google-secret-hiring-technique"
            target="_blank"

          and
          <a
            href="https://itsmohitt.medium.com/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f"

          to learn more about the challenge.<br />
          <br />
          The document is structured into five sections, one for each challenge,
          and each challenge contains a section for each task. In each task
          section, there are three main parts. The first is a simplified task
          description adapted from the original text which can be found in a
          black box. The second is an explanation of my own solution to the
          problem. And the third is my own Python code which can be revealed by
          clicking on on the relevant box. The constraints for coding in Python
          or Java are included below.<br />
          <br />
          If you wish to attempt a task yourself, I recommend you firstly read
          the task description, then think through the problem and write your
          own code. Feel free to search online regarding any relevant
          mathematical or coding principles, but do not search for a direct
          solution to the problem. If you find yourself stuck for a long time,
          then read my own solution explanation, but do not yet reveal my code.
          I recommend you only reveal and look through my code if you are
          absolutely stuck, or wish to compare your solution with mine.
          Remember, some of the challenges are difficult, and can take several
          hours or even several days to solve. Have fun!

              <br />
              Write a function solution(n) which takes in the starting index n
              of a string of all primes, "2357111317192329...", and returns the
              next five digits in the string. For example, if n is 3 then their
              ID number will be "71113". The value of n will always be between 0
              and 10000.<br />
              <br />
              -- Test cases --<br />
              Input : solution(0)<br />
              Output: 23571<br />
              <br />
              Input : solution(3)<br />
              Output: 71113
            </div>

            <p>
              If the string of prime numbers is known, then the solution is
              trivially given by returning the five digits starting at index
              \(n\). Therefore, I solved this problem by defining a function
              that firstly generated this string of primes. This function works
              by checking the primality of all integers from \(2\) to
              \(m=20+\lfloor n \ln 10 \rfloor \). This choice of \(m\) ensures
              that the resulting string of primes is at least \(n+5\) characters
              long, without too much excessive computation.<br />
              <br />
              This is a result of the prime number theorem which gives an
              asymptotic expression for the prime counting function,
              \[\pi(m)\sim{m\over \ln m},\] which counts the number of prime
              numbers \(\leqslant m\). The maximum number of digits each prime
              can have is \(\log m\) (base 10). Therefore, having \(n+5<
              \pi(m)\log m\) should ensure the resulting string is long enough
              when \(n\) is large. This condition is satisfied by \[m=20+\lfloor
              n \ln 10 \rfloor ,\] which I checked empirically worked for when
              \(n\) is low.<br />
              <br />
              Each integer is considered prime if no previously identified prime
              numbers divide it. This involves checking all previously
              identified prime numbers less than or equal to the square-root of
              the current candidate number (there is no point checking factors
              higher than the square-root because they all pair with divisors
              less than the square-root). Once the list of prime numbers is
              generated then the integers are converted to strings before being
              joined into a single string.

              You have L, a list containing some digits (0 to 9). Write a
              function solution(L) which finds the largest number that can be
              made from some or all of these digits and is divisible by 3. If it
              is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the solution. L
              will contain anywhere from 1 to 9 digits. The same digit may
              appear multiple times in the list, but each element in the list
              may only be used once.<br />
              <br />
              -- Test cases -- <br />
              Input : solution([3, 1, 4, 1])<br />

              <br />
              Input : solution([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])<br />
              Output: 94311<br />
            </div>

            <p>
              To solve this problem, let's first consider the simpler problem of
              finding the largest number containing all the digits in the list
              L. Obviously, this is achieved by sorting the list with the
              largest on the left to the smallest on the right, so that the
              larger digits correspond to the higher decimal positions. Removing
              any digit will strictly decrease the size of the number (except
              when all digits are zero). Therefore, this result forms an upper
              bound to the original problem of finding the largest number that
              is also divisible by three.<br />
              <br />
              Now we can make use of the property of decimal numbers that they
              are divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of their digits is also
              divisible by three. Or, more generally, that the number is
              congruent modulo 3 to its digit sum. Since the order of a
              summation does not effect the result, we can use this rule to
              check the modularity of a list of numbers without knowing the
              order. Next we note that removing any two digits never lowers the
              value by less than only removing any one digit. Also note that
              removing a larger digit will lower the value by more than removing
              a lower digit. Therefore, we can solve the problem by firstly
              minimising the number of digits that need to be removed, and then
              minimising the values of the removed digits.<br />
              <br />
              The sum of digits can be congruent to 0, 1 or 2 (mod 3). In the
              first case, any permutation of all digits is divisible by 3
              without removing any digits. Therefore, the solution returns the
              number containing all the digits in descending order. If the sum
              is congruent to 1 or 2, then there are three cases. Firstly, one
              of the digits is congruent to the sum, in which case, we just
              remove the smallest such digit. Secondly, two of the digits are
              congruent to twice the sum, in which case we remove the two
              smallest such digits. Thirdly, no combination of digits is
              divisible by 3, so return 0. After removing any digits, the
              solution is the number containing all the remaining digits in
              descending order. Note, that if there are no remaining digits,
              then return 0.

              Bunny Worker Locations<br />
              ======================<br />

              <br />
              In a triangular grid of values each cell can be represented as
              points (x, y), with x being the distance from the vertical wall,
              and y being the height from the ground. For example, the value at
              (1, 1) is 1, the value at (3, 2) is 9, and the value at (2,3) is
              8. This pattern of numbering continues indefinitely.<br />
              <br />
              | 7<br />
              | 4 8<br />
              | 2 5 9<br />
              | 1 3 6 10<br />
              <br />
              Write a function solution(x, y) which returns the grid value at
              the location (x, y). Both x and y will be at least 1 and no
              greater than 100,000. Since the values can be very large, return
              your solution as a string representation of the number.<br />
              <br />
              -- Test cases --<br />
              Input : solution(5, 10)<br />
              Output: 96<br />
              <br />
              Input : solution(3, 2)<br />
              Output: 9
            </div>

            <p>
              The grid changes by 1 each step along a diagonal, which gives the
              following recursive relationships \[f(x,y)=f(x+1,y-1)-1,\]
              \[f(x,y)=f(x+k,y-k)-k,\] where \(k\) can be any integer satisfying
              \(0 &lt; k &lt; y\). The grid coordinates can be as large as
              100000 so generating the entire grid would probably be much slower
              than directly calculating the values from a closed form expression
              for \(f(x,y)\). To find one, I first noticed that the first row is
              given by the triangular numbers. This makes sense since the values
              are given by the size of each diagonal, which grow by 1 each time.
              Therefore, \[f(x,1)=\sum_{k=1}^xk={x(x+1)\over 2}.\] So, we can
              get a closed form expression by choosing \(k=y-1\) in the
              recursive relationship and then using the result for \(f(x,1)\) by
              substituting \(x\rightarrow x+y-1\) \[f(x,y)={(x+y-1)(x+y)\over
              2}-y+1.\]

              <br />
              Write a function solution(map) that generates the length of the
              shortest path along a rectangular grid from (0,0) to (w-1,h-1),
              where w is the grid width, h is the grid height and the map is
              represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are passable space
              and 1s are impassable walls. The path may remove up to one wall.
              The path length is the total number of nodes you pass through,
              counting both the entrance and exit nodes. The starting and ending
              positions are always passable (0). The map will always be
              solvable, though you may or may not need to remove a wall. The
              height and width of the map can be from 2 to 20. Moves can only be
              made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed.<br />

              Write a function called solution(n) that takes a positive integer
              n and returns the number of different staircases that can be built
              from exactly n bricks. n will always be between 3 and 200
              (inclusive). Each type of staircase should consist of 2 or more
              steps with no two steps being at the same height. All steps must
              contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified as the
              total amount of bricks that make up that step.<br />
              <br />
              For example, when n = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build
              the staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and the
              second step having a height of 1: (# indicates a brick)<br />

              When n = 4, you still only have 1 staircase choice:<br />
              <br />

              But when n = 5, there are two ways you can build a staircase from
              the given bricks. The two staircases can have heights (4, 1) or
              (3, 2), as shown below:<br />

              The room has integer dimensions [1 < x_dim <= 1250, 1 < y_dim <=

              <br />
              For example, if you and the elite trainer were positioned in a

              trainer_position [2, 1], and a maximum shot distance of 4, you
              could shoot in seven different directions to hit the elite trainer
              (given as vector bearings from your location): [1, 0], [1, 2], [1,
              -2], [3, 2], [3, -2], [-3, 2], and [-3, -2]. As specific examples,
              the shot at bearing [1, 0] is the straight line horizontal shot of
              distance 1, the shot at bearing [-3, -2] bounces off the left wall
              and then the bottom wall before hitting the elite trainer with a
              total shot distance of sqrt(13), and the shot at bearing [1, 2]
              bounces off just the top wall before hitting the elite trainer
              with a total shot distance of sqrt(5).<br />

              Free the Bunny Workers<br />
              ======================<br />
              <br />
              Given the number of bunnies available and the number of locks
              required to open a work room, write a function solution(num_buns,
              num_required) which returns a specification of how to distribute
              the keys such that any num_required bunnies can open the locks,
              but no group of (num_required - 1) bunnies can.<br />
              <br />
              Each lock is numbered starting from 0. The keys are numbered the
              same as the lock they open (so for a duplicate key, the number
              will repeat, since it opens the same lock). For a given bunny, the
              keys they get is represented as a sorted list of the numbers for
              the keys. To cover all of the bunnies, the final solution is
              represented by a sorted list of each individual bunny's list of
              keys. Find the lexicographically least such key distribution -
              that is, the first bunny should have keys sequentially starting
              from 0.<br />
              <br />
              num_buns will always be between 1 and 9, and num_required will
              always be between 0 and 9 (both inclusive). For example, if you
              had 3 bunnies and required only 1 of them to open the cell, you
              would give each bunny the same key such that any of the 3 of them
              would be able to open it, like so:<br />
              <br />
              [<br />
              [0],<br />
              [0],<br />
              [0],<br />
              ]<br />
              <br />
              If you had 2 bunnies and required both of them to open the cell,
              they would receive different keys (otherwise they wouldn't both
              actually be required), and your solution would be as follows:<br />
              <br />
              [<br />
              [0],<br />
              [1],<br />
              ]<br />
              <br />
              Finally, if you had 3 bunnies and required 2 of them to open the
              cell, then any 2 of the 3 bunnies should have all of the keys
              necessary to open the cell, but no single bunny would be able to
              do it. Thus, the solution would be:<br />
              <br />
              [<br />
              [0, 1],<br />
              [0, 2],<br />
              [1, 2],<br />
              ]<br />
              <br />
              -- Test cases --<br />
              Input : solution(4, 4)<br />
              Output: [[0], [1], [2], [3]]<br />
              <br />
              Input : solution(5, 3)<br />
              Output: [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 4, 6, 7,
              9], [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]]<br />
              <br />
              Input : solution(2, 1)<br />
              Output: [[0], [0]]

              =================<br />
              <br />
              Write a function solution(str_n) which, given the string
              representation of an integer n, returns the sum of
              (floor(1*sqrt(2)) + floor(2*sqrt(2)) + ... + floor(n*sqrt(2))) as
              a string. That is, for every number i in the range 1 to n, it adds
              up all of the integer portions of i*sqrt(2).<br />
              <br />
              For example, if str_n was "5", the solution would be calculated
              as<br />
              floor(1*sqrt(2)) +<br />
              floor(2*sqrt(2)) +<br />
              floor(3*sqrt(2)) +<br />
              floor(4*sqrt(2)) +<br />
              floor(5*sqrt(2))<br />
              = 1+2+4+5+7 = 19<br />
              so the function would return "19".<br />
              <br />
              str_n will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^100, inclusive.
              Since n can be very large (up to 101 digits!), using just sqrt(2)
              and a loop won't work. Sometimes, it's easier to take a step back
              and concentrate not on what you have in front of you, but on what
              you don't.<br />
