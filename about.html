        <h1>ChatGPT's Introduction to Lachlan</h1>
        <p>
          Dr. Lachlan Gibson is an Australian citizen who has a diverse
          educational background in physics, data science, and mathematics. He
          completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Physics) from the University of
          Queensland in 2019, where his research focused on hydrodynamic forces
          in optical tweezers. He continued his academic pursuits with a Master
          of Data Science from the University of Queensland in 2020, where he
          worked on his capstone project, Categorical Vector Clustering, aimed
          at revealing hidden features of votes and voters.<br />
          <br />
          Dr. Gibson has had several work experiences in the field of research
          and education. He worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the
          University of Queensland from August 2020 to December 2022. During his
          tenure, he was involved in rare-event simulation research and
          reinforcement learning applied to AI safety, and environmental effects
          on fishery risk and reinforcement learning methods for controlling
          restless multi-armed bandits.<br />
          <br />
          In addition to research, Dr. Gibson also has experience in academic
          tutoring and peer-assisted learning. He has worked as an academic
          tutor for the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of
          Queensland from 2016 to 2020, where he taught tutorials, practicals,
          and contact classes for various courses. He has also worked as a Peer
          Assistant Tutor and PASS Leader, where he consulted students in the
          Science Learning Centre for physics and mathematics inquiries and
          facilitated PASS classes for PHYS1002 Electromagnetism and Modern
          Physics.<br />
          <br />
          Dr. Gibson has also been involved in various volunteer works,
          including serving as an Assistant Secretary at Salisbury Baptist
          Church from 2020 to 2022, working with the pastorate (secretary,
          treasurer and senior pastor), and operating the sound system for
          regular services, band practices, and live streams. He has also been a
          Youth Leader at Salisbury Baptist Church from 2014 to 2017, where he
          mentored and led high school students from the church and local
          community, and a Winter SMADD Camp Leader at Scripture Union from 2011
          to 2016, where he worked with a team of volunteers to run an annual
          weeklong creative arts camp for high schoolers.<br />
